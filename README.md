# Python Fundamentals

## Day 1 – Python Core Review
- Messed around with lists, tuples, and dictionaries
- Tried some advanced list/dict stuff: slicing, comprehensions, `.items()`, `.keys()`  
- Made little scripts to sum stuff, get averages, check if numbers are integers  
- Committed to Git  

## Day 2 – String Fun & Comprehensions
- Built some mini programs:
  - Palindrome checker
  - Word counter with search
  - Acronym generator  
- Played with string methods and f-strings  
- Added docstrings because, why not  
- Tried making everything a bit “Pythonic” with list comprehensions  
- Pushed day’s work to Git  

## Day 3 – Loops & Conditionals Madness
- Practiced nested `if…else` and loops  
- Made scripts to get largest, smallest, and average from a list  
- Added input validation so my code doesn’t explode  
- Wrote some simple `assert` tests just to feel fancy  
- Compared `for` vs `while` loops like a nerd  

## Day 4 – Error Handling & Debugging
- Learned about exceptions and `try…except`  
- Built robust input programs with custom errors and logging  
- Debugged stuff (divide by zero rage quit moments included)  
- Made a custom exception class just because I can  
- Accidentally “practiced” using pdb style debugging  
- Logs (`errors.log`) created but safely ignored in Git with `.gitignore` (ps: idk if i managed to do that, still new to this git thingy)

## Day 5 – Functions & Lambda Experiments
- Dived into functions, default args, and type hints  
- Messed with lambda functions using `map` and `filter`  
- Made higher-order functions that take other functions (feels powerful)  
- Accidentally created a little CLI-style thing: enter numbers, choose operations (square, double, triple), and it tells you if the sum is odd or even (How do i know its a "CLI": When i gave my code to chatGPT it said so)  
- Added some error handling for fun  
- Committed all the madness to Git
